## Relativity AI Job - Function

## Purpose

Usually, we can break down employment categories for any role as junior, average, and senior. Our system mainly helps a person progress from Graduate → Level 01 → Entry level → Associate to become qualified for Junior level , which is the final stage before focusing on the skill gap between junior and average levels.

- With current market competition and a rising number of graduates seeking jobs each year, we help you develop the skills needed for employment in a smarter, structured manner.
- Market signal: campus hiring is flat to slightly up for the Class of 2025, with growing skills-based hiring -which rewards applicants who can evidence concrete skills and artifacts.

## Relativity AI Job - What It Does

## Principle

Plan the problem → provide the personalized plan → execute the plan.

Every job field has an explicit skill set. Relativity AI designs a strategic learning plan before giving resources, using the learner's preferences to drive how skills are acquired.

## Personalization inputs (examples):

- How you perceive knowledge best.
- The ways you get things right most consistently (e.g., code-along, projects, quizzes).
- How you like to study (pace, depth, medium).

## Value &amp; Preparation

With these insights, we craft the best strategy before execution -helping you learn the way you prefer and think outside the box . Rather than just dumping resources, Relativity AI specializes in smart execution tactics and proven study strategies. Every skill is tied to forms of intelligence.

## Brain Development vs. Skills Development

Developing skills develops brain intelligence . The more we learn to develop skills, the more intelligence grows. Intelligence influences success in a chosen career; it varies by person and can be enhanced to a degree. It can be categorized and strongly relates to skill sets-i.e., skill level is proportional to intelligence .

For a given skill set, a population's intelligence distribution typically concentrates around lower, average, and higher levels.

Diagram note: The first box represents intelligence concentration before using Relativity AI.

Diagram note: The subsequent boxes illustrate how our agentic intelligence system helps shift both skills +

intelligence to the levels needed.

## Example: Backend Developer Intelligence Components

- Foundational problem-solving intelligence
- Core technical intelligence
- Collaborative and communication intelligence

Therefore, two main strategies prepare you to become an industry-standard, impactful professional:

- Build intelligence through resources while learning
- Provide workout routines and brain exercises to enhance the cognitive + intelligence capabilities needed for the role

## General Goals

- 1) Shifting Intelligence

The target is to shift the intelligence level for an identified skill set to a higher, achievable level. While it can't be fully transformed for everyone (depending on capability and dedication), after identifying insights + the problem and estimating an intelligence level, we guide you step-by-step to achieve:

- Strong cognitive and analytical abilities to challenge peers, think critically, and solve problems effectively.
- Clear career direction and skill-growth plan , with the ability to showcase strengths, stand out, and position yourself well in the market.
- An effective, adaptive learning approach matched to your abilities-so you excel in studies and hit your goals.

## 2) Helping to Think Outside the Box

- Not only build skills but raise IQ-like capabilities , bringing a new idea to skill development. Current platforms mostly suggest resources and a roadmap (which can fade over time).
- To perform well in any career, people must think and work intelligently . Simply learning required content only improves intelligence to a certain level and may not suit highly critical environments .
- We develop the brain structure you need to be a skillful, impactful individual in your chosen career. Learning alone boosts intelligence; our method enhances beyond what learning alone can do .

## How It Works

- Personalized learning can produce positive but context-dependent gains; impact varies by implementation quality -hence the plan-first approach with checkpoints.
- Brain intelligence: shifting intelligence to a new level helps you stand out from the crowd.
- High-utility study techniques (e.g., spaced practice, retrieval practice, interleaving) consistently outperform passive review; the plan bakes these into weekly cadences .

## Flow

1. Profile &amp; constraints: capture learning preferences, schedule, and current baseline.
2. Milestone design: define week-by-week goals with evidence gates (quiz thresholds, code reviews, miniprojects).
3. Delivery: assign right-sized drills, portfolio tasks, and feedback loops.
4. Review &amp; adapt: refine the plan using performance data and user feedback.

## Success

Success depends highly on the person. Effectiveness can be guaranteed only if they perform according to plan. Relativity AI provides the execution plan and guidance -but implementation is up to the user .
