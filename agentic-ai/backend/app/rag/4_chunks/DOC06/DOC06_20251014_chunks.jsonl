Because they are scoped to a single objective, problem-oriented insights operate on a shorter lifecycle: they must be verified, timestamped, and refreshed as the situation changes. They often include unknowns or hypotheses that the plan should test (e.g., 'we think X is the bottleneck'), plus edge cases and failure modes to guard against. UIA translates these particulars into actionable requirements and constraints for UPA so the planner can choose the right strategy, sequence, and safeguards.\n\nBased on general and problem-oriented insights, UPA decides where to begin and how to begin to help the user achieve the goal.
